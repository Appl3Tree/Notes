# Module 1: IEEE 802.11

## IEEE

IEEE - The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.

## 802.11 Standards and Amendments

### IEEE 802.11

Uses _Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance_ (CSMA/CA). Uses the 2.4 GHz band.

### IEEE 802.11b

Added _Complementary Code Keying_ (CCK). Uses the 2.4 GHz band.

### IEEE 802.11a

Uses _Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing_ (OFDM). Uses the 5 GHz band.

### IEEE 802.11g

Same OFDN, but on the 2.4 GHz band.

### IEEE 802.11n

Uses the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands.

### IEEE 802.11ac

Uses the 5 GHz band.

### IEEE 802.11ad

Also known as _WiGig_. Uses the 60 GHz band.

### IEEE 802.11ax

Also known as _High Efficiency_ (HE). Uses the 2.4, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands.

### IEEE 802.11h

Provides _Dynamic Frequency Selection_ (DFS) and _Transmit Power Control_ (TPC). Uses the 5 GHz band.

## Antenna Diversity vs MIMO

### Antenna Diversity

Uses multiple antennas to improve quality. Antenna diversity is where a receiver will use the antenna with the strongest signal. It is generally utilized to make improvements when receiving, but can be used for transmitting as well

### MIMO

MIMO splits the data into multiple streams and uses multiple antennas to send them. The receiver then combines the streams.
