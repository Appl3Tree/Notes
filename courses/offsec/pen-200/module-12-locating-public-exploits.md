# Module 12: Locating Public Exploits

## Getting Started

### A Word of Caution

{% hint style="warning" %}
Read code before executing it if you didn't write it. Don't be stupid.
{% endhint %}

## Online Exploit Resources

### The Exploit Database

{% embed url="https://www.exploit-db.com/" %}

Useful columns on the Exploit-DB outside the obvious.&#x20;

1. D: Download the exploit.
2. A: Download the application files for investigation/review.
3. V: Specifies if the exploit is verified.

### Packet Storm

### Google Search Operators

Google Dorking, pretty straight-forward.

## Offline Exploit Resources

### Exploit Frameworks

Some exploit frameworks:

* Metasploit
* Core Impact
* Canvas
* Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF)

### SearchSploit

Local copy of the exploit database is stored in `/usr/share/exploitdb/`. This directory is split into **exploits** and **shellcodes**. It contains CSV files for each of the directories with information on all files in the two subdirectories.

Copy an exploit to your current directory: `searchsploit -m path/to/exploit.py` or `searchsploit -m edb-id`

### Nmap NSE Scripts

Nmap's Scripting Engine directory can be found at `/usr/share/nmap/scripts/`. Information on the scripts can be found by running `nmap --script-help=script-name.nse`.

## Exploiting a Target

### Putting It Together

Nothin' specific to this section, note-wise. This was a walkthrough of using what was covered in the module to exploit a target.

Automatic URL encoding for those pesky web RCEs:\
`curl http://target/path/to/backdoor.php --data-urlencode "cmd=which nc"`
