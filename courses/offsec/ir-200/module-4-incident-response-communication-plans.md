### Be a Good Communicator

The seven circumstances of rhetorical thinking, with a cyber spin:

* What happened (data breach, denial of service, etc.)?
* When did it happen (timestamps, timeline)?
* Why did it happen (to obtain data, to hold the company to ransom, etc.)?
* Where did it happen (scope of the incident)?
* Who did it (attribution)?
* With what did it happen (type of malware, botnet used, etc.)?
* How did it happen (weaknesses enabling foothold, access, escalation etc.)?

## Communication During a Crisis
