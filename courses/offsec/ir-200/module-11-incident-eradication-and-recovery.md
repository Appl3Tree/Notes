# Module 11: Incident Eradication and Recovery

## Eradication

### Developing an Eradication Plan

1. List every hosts and device affected.
2. Perform a complete wipe and reimage of affected system(s).
3. Pinpoint initial point of infection, identify IoCs, and assess affected processes/applications on each system.
4. Reset passwords for compromised/partially compromised accounts.

### Eradicating Threats

Remove malicious artifacts/threats via manual/automated eradication.

### Reimaging

Partial reimaging is aimed at restoring only certain parts affected, i.e. OS if data disks/network drives are unaffected.&#x20;

## Recovery

### Business Impact and Recovery

_Identify and prioritize vital systems and data._

### Recovery on Data-Heavy Components

_Best to use incremental backups for these data-heavy components. Snapshots are also instrumental._

### Validating the Recovery Process

_Be thorough in post-recovery threat assessments. Simulate real-world attacks through penetration testing and red teaming._
