### Incident Information

_**Phase 1** begins when the SOC team notices that several Splunk alerts have been triggered. They escalate the situation to you, a member of the Incident Response team. Your task is to review the triggered alerts, determine which are false positives, and identify the one(s) requiring detailed investigation._

_**Phase 2** involves performing a forensic analysis on a disk image provided by a colleague from another branch of the company's Incident Response team. Based on their analysis, the disk image may contain the key to decrypt all files affected by a ransomware attack in their branch._

## Scoring Mechanism

_Enter required information via the flags.exe to get a hash. If it matches one of their provided 10, enter it as the answer._

## Next Steps

_Do the Challenge Lab and take the exam._
