# Module 5: Common Attack Techniques

## Indicators of Compromise (IOC) and Cybersecurity Frameworks

### Indicators of Compromise

_Hashes, domains, IPs, tools, etc._

### Cybersecurity Frameworks

_Cyber Kill Chain_

_MITRE ATT\&CK_

_MITRE D3FEND_

_The Diamond Model_

## Opportunistic Attacks

### Phishing and Credential Stealing

_All the \*ishings. Defang malicious URLs when sharing._

### Ransomware

_It's ransomware... if you don't know what it is, these notes probably aren't for you right now._

### Denial of Service (DoS)

_It's in the title. There's a handful of "types", just google 'em if it matters._

### Automated Network Attacks

_Also in the title... not much to add here. Instead of someone doing an attack manually... it's been automated..._ ðŸ¤¯

## Targeted Attacks

### Initial Access

_Most often it's phishing._

### C2 and Persistence

_Command and Control. Remotely control/manipulate compromised devices en masse._

### Lateral Movement

_Moving horizontally, i.e. laterally, through the network from system to system. Some examples include Pass the Hash/Ticket, Kerberoasting, etc._

### Domain Persistence

Check out skeleton keys, pretty neat AD persistence:
