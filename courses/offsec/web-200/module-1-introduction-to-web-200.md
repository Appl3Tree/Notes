# Module 1: Introduction to WEB-200

## Secrets of Success with WEB-200

### Think Offensively to Improve Defense

> ## If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.
>
> ## â€• Sun Tzu, The Art of War

### Adopt a Growth Mindset

_Be flexible, continue learning. Don't get stuck in your ways because the way you know it is the end-all be-all. Don't let yourself or your skills wither away because you're comfortable._

### Try Harder

_Don't give up. If you get stuck, sometimes a break is needed but it doesn't mean you should quit. Dig deeper and try again. Real life doesn't provide "free hints" when you get stuck, you either dig in and keep trying or you get left behind._

### Collect Data and Do Your Research

When you get lost in the sauce or don't understand something, identify the important information and do research to learn.&#x20;
