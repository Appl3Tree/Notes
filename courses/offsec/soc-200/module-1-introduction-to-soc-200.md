# Module 1: Introduction to SOC-200

## Secrets of Success with SOC-200

### Understand Offense to Improve Defense

We must understand how attacks are performed in order to detect and defend from them.

### A Mindset of Learning

There's always someone better, i.e. you will never not have room to grow. Keep going.

### Collect Data and Do Your Research

There's no way to cover everything in one course, collect your data and do the research to understand it.

## Getting Started with SOC-200

### The Course Structure

Like all the other OffSec courses. Read/watch the material, then practice it hands-on.

### Lab Overview

The lab environment consists of several components:

1. A Kali Linux virtual machine (VM)
2. The Online Portal
3. A collection of machines running in the lab
4. A VPN connection from the Kali VM to the lab environment

### Connecting to the VPN

Use openvpn to start the connection.

### Disconnecting from the VPN

Just ctrl+c the running process or kill it some other way.
