> These will be the notes I felt were worth writing down as things I was not completely familiar with and/or were new to me at the time of working through this course.

Originally I planned on taking notes on this course however the exam was scheduled and taken only a couple days after I began getting these Notes and my Write-ups setup.

I **highly** recommend taking a look at 0xjamesli's guide for this course. They did a fantastic job taking note of key information without fluff. Do take the p.s. seriously.

> p.s. This guide only serves as reference purposes and it doesn't contain every single point from the chapters. Hence, I still highly recommend that you read through the chapters at least once.
