# Introduction to SIEM

## Section Introduction

Overview of SIEM’s history, combining SIM and SEM to enable centralized logging for detecting and responding to security events across systems and networks.

***

## Security Information Management (SIM)

Security Information Management (SIM) is software designed to collect, monitor, and analyze event logs generated by security devices such as IDS, IPS, antivirus, and firewalls. It centralizes this data in a single platform, enabling investigators and security teams to better track activity across an organization’s network.

***

### What Does SIM Do?

SIM focuses on gathering and translating information about network operations. It collects data and logs from internal devices and, in some cases, from external sources like public threat intelligence services. By detecting patterns, SIM systems analyze device behavior and present findings through reports, graphs, and charts. Key functions include:

* Real-time event monitoring.
* Alerting and report generation.
* Automated incident response.
* Correlating data from multiple sources for improved accuracy.
* Translating diverse log formats into a common structure, often via XML.

Although powerful, SIM tools require skilled security personnel and effective security policies to operate effectively.

***

### Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:**

* Simple deployment.
* Capable of storing and analyzing large volumes of logs.
* Provides fast and efficient event analysis.
* Correlates events for accurate system insights.
* Supports streamlined threat management, including assessment, containment, and analysis.

**Disadvantages:**

* Often costly to implement.
* May not fully adapt to every organizational environment.
* Some vendors offer limited technical support.

While SIM cannot prevent all threats, it significantly improves the chances of detecting suspicious activity early, often making the difference between a timely response and a data breach.

***

## Security Event Management (SEM)

Security Event Management (SEM) is software designed to identify, collect, monitor, evaluate, notify, and correlate events and alerts in real time. It focuses on detecting suspicious activity within computer systems—such as network devices, IDS/IPS, firewalls, and antivirus software—so security teams can respond quickly and effectively to incidents.

***

### What Does SEM Do?

SEM solutions continuously monitor and analyze system events to detect anomalies that may indicate threats, infections, or other incidents. Core functions include:

* Real-time monitoring of system events.
* Collecting security events from devices and applications.
* Correlating events to provide a clear overview of the system.
* Prioritizing and analyzing logs based on importance.
* Enabling real-time incident response.

These tools apply algorithms, statistical methods, and vulnerability databases to evaluate risks such as unusual logins, suspicious web traffic, or outdated software. Findings are communicated through reports, charts, and, in critical cases, alerts such as SMS notifications.

***

### Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:**

* Consolidates information from multiple devices and sources.
* Reduces false positives and false negatives.
* Improves response time to internal and external threats.

**Disadvantages:**

* Complex deployment process.
* High implementation cost.
* Automated analysis can still produce false positives and negatives.

While SEM tools enhance security monitoring and response, automation alone is insufficient. Human oversight remains essential to maintain both system security and operational stability over time.

***

## What is a SIEM?

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a software solution that aggregates and analyzes activity across an organization’s IT infrastructure. It combines Security Information Management (SIM) and Security Event Management (SEM), using rules and statistical correlations to turn logs and events into actionable intelligence.

SIEM collects data from network devices, servers, domain controllers, and other sources. It then stores, normalizes, aggregates, and applies analytics to help detect threats, support incident response, and enable forensic investigations.

Implementing SIEM is complex, requiring integration with existing security infrastructure, planning for log collection and storage, and creating detection rules and reports. When properly configured, SIEM removes blind spots across the network by correlating events and displaying them through a dashboard for security analysts.

### Benefits of a SIEM

**Advanced Threat Detection**\
Traditional tools such as firewalls and antivirus often miss sophisticated attacks. SIEM provides continuous, real-time monitoring and correlation across the enterprise, improving detection of advanced threats such as insider activity and data exfiltration.

**Forensics and Incident Response**\
SIEM stores historical logs securely and offers tools for fast correlation and analysis. This enables security teams to investigate incidents efficiently while maintaining evidence integrity for legal proceedings.

**Compliance Reporting and Auditing**\
Organizations often deploy SIEM to meet regulatory requirements such as HIPAA, PCI/DSS, SOX, FERPA, and HITECH. SIEM aggregates logs and produces audit-ready reports to demonstrate compliance.

**Additional Benefits**

* Centralized data storage.
* Support for certifications like ISO 27000–27003.
* Log management and retention.
* Case management and ticketing integration.
* Policy enforcement validation and violation tracking.

## SIEM Platforms

This lesson explores different SIEM platforms, their capabilities, strengths, and weaknesses. It also introduces the primary platform used in this course: Splunk.

***

### Graylog

[Graylog](https://www.graylog.org/) offers two products:

* **Graylog Open Source** – Free to use and available for download.
* **Graylog Enterprise** – Paid version, free for small organizations (under 50 staff, less than 2 GB of events per day).

Graylog provides log collection, search, and visualization features, making it accessible for smaller teams while offering enterprise-grade capabilities for larger organizations.

***

### ArcSight

[ArcSight](https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/products/siem-security-information-event-management/overview), also called **ArcSight Enterprise Security Management (ESM)**, supports layered analytics by integrating with a wide range of commercial tools.

Key features include:

* Real-time correlation for threat detection in large datasets.
* Security Automation and Orchestration (SOAR) workflows for automated incident response.

***

### QRadar

[QRadar](https://www.ibm.com/uk-en/security/security-intelligence/qradar) provides core SIEM functions with additional options:

* Imports data from threat intelligence feeds.
* Optional subscription to **IBM Security X-Force Threat Intelligence** for enriched investigations and real-time alerts.
* Add-on modules for incident response, risk management, and vulnerability management.

***

### LogRhythm

[LogRhythm](https://logrhythm.com/) emphasizes advanced analytics and visibility through:

* Machine learning and behavioral analytics (UEBA).
* Security Automation and Response (SOAR).
* Network Detection and Response (NDR).

It also highlights reporting capabilities to demonstrate security program improvements and provide metrics for executives.

***

### Splunk

[Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/platform.html) is one of the most widely adopted SIEM platforms.

Features include:

* Extensible functionality through downloadable “Apps.”
* Custom search queries for data analysis and alerting.
* Visual dashboards for monitoring and reporting.

Splunk’s flexibility and popularity make it a central tool in many SOC environments and the platform used in this course for SIEM training.
