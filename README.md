# Overview

{% hint style="success" %}
Hack Responsibly.

Always ensure you have **explicit** permission to access any computer system **before** using any of the techniques contained in these documents. You accept full responsibility for your actions by applying any knowledge gained here.
{% endhint %}

These are my publicly accessible notes from various sources for penetration testing, red-teaming, OSCP, Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges, and my [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/)/ [Hack the Box](https://hackthebox.eu) machine [write-ups](https://appl3tree.github.io/).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Warning - These notes are largely unformatted right now. They are based on my way of learning things - by reading, doing, studying, exploring, and taking notes. Cleaning up and formatting comes later.

* Do not assume anything from these notes.
* Do not expect the notes to be exhaustive, or to cover the techniques or the output they produce in full.
* Expect mistakes in the notes.
* Feel free to ask questions!
* Always consult additional resources. If possible I will try to link to outside resources. _If I have shared something of yours and you want credit, please let me know!_
